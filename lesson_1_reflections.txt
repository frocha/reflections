How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped me by saving time, by focusing on the lines that have changed between versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because I can locate bugs even if they were introduced a long time ago.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manual
pro: flexibility
con: prone to errors, tedious

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Depends on the type of content.

>> How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows commits and git diff shows changes between commits

>> How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It would allow me to revert to previous versions more easily.

>> Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
